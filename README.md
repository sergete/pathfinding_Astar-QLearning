# pathfinding_Astar-QLearning

This project is about the implementation of a Pathfinding A star algorithm in out first scene
Hill climbing algorithm to catch all enemies and once all enemies have been catched calculate the path to the goal with the pathfinding A star algorithm
And in the third scene implement a Q Learning algorithm to learn to find the goal.

If you can execute the Unity Project just read the document Importante Leer antes de Ejecutar maybe you have to translate it to english.
And a .pdf with a brief explanation about the project. (In spanish too)
